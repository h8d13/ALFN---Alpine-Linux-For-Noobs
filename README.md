# ALFN---Alpine-Linux-For-Noobs

Follow up on the arch linux for noob guide. Go check it out or this won't make sense.

Follow the steps, case sensitive. Use most default first options personally. Create a user as it will allow you to skip: setup-user

apk update
apk upgrade

- setup-xorg-base 
- setup-desktop

Apk search <whatdoyouwant?>

poweroff / reboot

Coolest part of alpine is that with all the tools for Gnome my install only was only about 3GB.

`Finished! Processed 2926.81 MB in 4.72 seconds (620.26 MB/s)` 

That's it. It's quite cool.

Struggled a but with the Keyboard locales being reset when using a DE. Had to go to `/etc/conf.d/loadkeys`
